/**
 * Branch out the source Observable values as a nested Observable periodically
 * in time.
 *
 * <span class="informal">It's like {@link bufferTime}, but emits a nested
 * Observable instead of an array.</span>
 *
 * ![](windowTime.png)
 *
 * Returns an Observable that emits windows of items it collects from the source
 * Observable. The output Observable starts a new window periodically, as
 * determined by the `windowCreationInterval` argument. It emits each window
 * after a fixed timespan, specified by the `windowTimeSpan` argument. When the
 * source Observable completes or encounters an error, the output Observable
 * emits the current window and propagates the notification from the source
 * Observable. If `windowCreationInterval` is not provided, the output
 * Observable starts a new window when the previous window of duration
 * `windowTimeSpan` completes. If `maxWindowCount` is provided, each window
 * will emit at most fixed number of values. Window will complete immediately
 * after emitting last value and next one still will open as specified by
 * `windowTimeSpan` and `windowCreationInterval` arguments.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * In every window of 1 second each, emit at most 2 click events
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { fromEvent, windowTime, map, take, mergeAll } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * const result = clicks.pipe(
 *   windowTime(1000),
 *   map(win => win.pipe(take(2))), // take at most 2 emissions from each window
 *   mergeAll()                     // flatten the Observable-of-Observables
 * );
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 * ```
 *
 * Every 5 seconds start a window 1 second long, and emit at most 2 click events per window
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { fromEvent, windowTime, map, take, mergeAll } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * const result = clicks.pipe(
 *   windowTime(1000, 5000),
 *   map(win => win.pipe(take(2))), // take at most 2 emissions from each window
 *   mergeAll()                     // flatten the Observable-of-Observables
 * );
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 * ```
 *
 * Same as example above but with `maxWindowCount` instead of `take`
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { fromEvent, windowTime, mergeAll } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * const result = clicks.pipe(
 *   windowTime(1000, 5000, 2), // take at most 2 emissions from each window
 *   mergeAll()                 // flatten the Observable-of-Observables
 * );
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
